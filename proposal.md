Certainly! To adapt this process for the JSON data you provided (which seems to be an audit log from a command-line operation), follow these steps:

### Step 1: Analyze the JSON Structure
Look at the JSON structure to understand how it's formatted. Since I don't have the actual JSON file, I'll make assumptions based on the screenshot provided. It appears to contain fields like `RESOURCE`, `Verb`, `Resource`, `Namespace`, and `User`.

### Step 2: Design the MySQL Database Schema
Create a table to store audit log entries. Here's an example schema based on the screenshot:

```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  resource VARCHAR(255),
  verb VARCHAR(50),
  resource_type VARCHAR(255),
  namespace VARCHAR(255),
  user_id VARCHAR(255),
  timestamp DATETIME
);
```

### Step 3: Write a JSON Parsing Script
Assuming the JSON file is an array of log entries, here's how you could parse it using Python:

```python
import mysql.connector
import json
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to the database
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='username', password='password',
                              host='127.0.0.1',
                              database='your_database')
cursor = cnx.cursor()

# Parse JSON and insert into the database
with open('audit_logs.json', 'r') as file:
    data = json.load(file)
    for entry in data:
        timestamp = datetime.strptime(entry['TIME'], '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')
        cursor.execute("""
            INSERT INTO audit_logs (resource, verb, resource_type, namespace, user_id, timestamp)
            VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)
        """, (entry['RESOURCE'], entry['Verb'], entry['Resource'], entry['Namespace'], entry['User'], timestamp))

# Commit changes and close connection
cnx.commit()
cursor.close()
cnx.close()
```

### Step 4: Set Up an Express.js Backend
Continue with the backend setup as previously described, creating endpoints that correspond to the data you wish to retrieve and display.

### Step 5: Create the Frontend Web Page
On your frontend, you would now modify the JavaScript to handle the specific structure of your audit log data. This might include formatting timestamps, and displaying user actions, etc.

### Step 6: Deploy the Application
Deploy the application as described earlier.

### Important Considerations:
- **Timestamps**: The `TIME` field must be converted into a format that MySQL understands (like `DATETIME`).
- **Security**: Ensure that the script sanitizes the input to prevent SQL injection.
- **File Handling**: The script assumes the JSON file is named `audit_logs.json` and is in the same directory as the script.
- **Error Handling**: Add proper error handling for database operations and file reading.

This script and process would need to be run regularly if new JSON files are being generated continually. You might set up a cron job to execute the script at intervals or trigger the script to run after a new file is created, depending on your infrastructure.
